**Trust in the Lord with all your heart And do not lean on your own understanding. In all your ways acknowledge Him, And He will make your paths straight. Do not be wise in your own eyes; Fear the Lord and turn away from evil.**
– [Proverbs 3:5-7 NASB](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Proverbs+3%3A5-7&version=NASB;KJV)

**Conduct yourselves with wisdom toward outsiders, making the most of the opportunity.**
– [Colossians 4:5 NASB](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Colossians+4%3A5&version=NASB,KJV)

**So then, be careful how you walk, not as unwise people but as wise, making the most of your time, because the days are evil. Therefore do not be foolish, but understand what the will of the Lord is.**
– [Ephesians 5:15-17 NASB](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians+5%3A15-17&version=NASB,KJV)
